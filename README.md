# Course Project
## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.<br>
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>

## Steps to work on this course project
1.Download the data source and unzip to folder /data/<br>
2.Put run_analysis.R  in the parent folder of data<br>
3.Run source("run_analysis.R"), it will generate a new file tiny.txt in your working directory<br>
