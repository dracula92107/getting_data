# The data source
* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


# Transformation
## There are 5 parts:
### 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
### 5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
