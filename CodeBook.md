# CodeBook
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

# The data source
•Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
•Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


# Transformation
There are 5 parts:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
