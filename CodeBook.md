# CodeBook
This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

# The data source
* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
* Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 


# Transformation
There are 5 parts:<br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.<br>
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>
